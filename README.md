# ArtSense
ArtSense aims to address the lack of interactivity in traditional art installations, which often limits audience engagement. In a digital age where interactive experiences captivate younger audiences, static art forms may struggle to maintain interest. With IoT, creating a dynamic, multi-sensory interactive installation, the project seeks to bridge the gap between traditional art and modern technology, making art more engaging, accessible, and relevant. This approach encourages viewers to actively participate in the art experience rather than being passive observers, creating a deeper emotional connection and understanding of the art.
